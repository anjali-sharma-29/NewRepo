In my RabbitMQ blog post, we delved into how the pub/sub messaging model can be implemented using RabbitMQ to enable seamless communication across applications. 
We noticed that this process involves several steps like connection managment, message serialization/deserialization, requiring microservices to subscribe to a specific topic and bind queues, setting up queues,
and addressing the challenge of code redundancy. To overcome these hurdles, we can leverage EasyNetQ, a .NET Client API  which is wrapper on native RabbitMQ Client. Opting EasyNetQ over the native RabbitMQ client for your .NET applications can offer several benefits, particularly in terms of simplifying development and reducing the complexity associated with direct RabbitMQ interactions.
In this blog post, I'll highlight the advantages of using EasyNetQ over plain RabbitMQ and provide a walkthrough on its implementation.

## Key Features of EasyNetQ

1. ## Simplified API :
   Offers a more user-friendly API than RabbitMQ's .NET client, easing common tasks like message publishing and subscribing.
   
3. ## Automatic Serialization/Deserialization:
   Automatically converts messages to and from JSON, eliminating the need for extra coding.

4. ## Easy Configuration:
   Streamlines the RabbitMQ setup process, great for beginners or those who want a quick configuration.

5. ## Support for Advanced Patterns:
    Accommodates complex messaging patterns, including RPC and topic-based publishing, with little configuration.

6. ## Robust Error Handling and Resilience::
    Features like automatic reconnection in the event of a connection failure, which enhances the stability of your messaging system.

7. ## Asynchronous Programming Support:
   Designed for modern .NET async programming, aiding in building scalable, efficient applications.

8. ## Active Community and Documentation:
    Benefits from an active community and comprehensive documentation.

9. ## Reduced Complexity:
   By abstracting the complexities of RabbitMQ, EasyNetQ allows developers to focus more on business logic rather than the intricacies of the messaging infrastructure.

   EasyNetQ follow simple conventions:
> 1. Messages should be represented by .NET types.
> 2. Messages should be routed by their .NET type.
